# Futterautomat
# This is my second coding project. My goal was to create a machine to feed my cat by using a RaspberryPi.
# The output of the feed is based on its level, which is measured by weight. 
# The output of treats works via voice control, which I implemented using the Google Speech API. 
# I built a construction out of Lego that realizes the output via servo motors.
